                    Typesetting The ImageJ User Guide
                       Tiago Ferreira, June 2012

Introduction
============
These are the (in)complete instructions required to publish the ImageJ
User Guide, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/

Requirements
============
1) A full TeX Live installation: http://www.tug.org/texlive/
   Around 40 packages are required to build the guide properly. Minimal
   TeX distributions may not be sufficient. If space is a concern - a 
   full installation may take up tp 2GB -, you can always use tlmgr (the
   package manager distributed with TeXLive to trim your installation,
   e.g., by removing multi-language support. See 
   <http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html> for details. To give you an
   idea, the guide for IJ 1.44o required the following packages:
      {amsmath},{amssymb},{appendix},{array},{babel},{booktabs},{calc},
      {caption},{colortbl},{color},{fancyhdr},{fancy},{fix-cm},{float},
      {fontenc},{footmisc},{framed},{geometry},{graphicx},{hyperref},
      {listings},{longtable},{makeidx},{microtype},{multicol},
      {multirow},{nomencl},{pdfpages},{placeins},{prettyref},{rotating},
      {sectsty},{setspace},{setspace},{SIunits},{textcomp},{textcomp},
      {tocloft},{todonotes},{ulem},{units},{url},{varioref},{wrapfig},
      {xcolor},{xifthen}      
    Use the texdoc utility to open the documentation for a particular
    package, e.g.,
        $ texdoc xcolor

2) Lyx (http://www.lyx.org), eLyXer (http://elyxer.nongnu.org/) and
   Python (http://www.python.org/) are required to produce the HTML
   version of the guide

Usage
=====
As of v1.44 edition, LyX is preferentially used. The reason for this is
eLyXer, currently the best available HTML converter. eLyXer produces far
better results than tex4ht, hevea, tth or latex2html. If you don't feel
comfortable with TeX this may be good news, since LyX offers the ease of
use of a graphical interface for TeX/LaTeX. If on the other hand, you
are a TeX connoisseur and think LyX is a fragility, please know that
eLyXer may be able to parse TeX directly in a near future. Right now,
however, LyX is required for the HTML output.
The pdf compilation, on the other hand, can be created directly from
pdflatex and is fully independent from LyX. The only (innocuous) issue
with this approach is that the TeX files produced by LyX may have
preambles with repeated commands, sometimes arranged in an awkward way.

Structure
=========
The guide is divided into a set of child documents: 01-,02-,... etc.
These are all included in the "user-guide" main file. All illustrations
are placed inside the "images" subfolder. pdftex supports png, pdf and
jpg. The "ImageJRefs.bib" file contains the bibliography listed in the
'IJ related publications' appendix. Covers are in the ./cover folder

Bibliographic Styles
====================
The guide uses "plainurl", "plainyr-rev", or a variant. These are
bibliographic styles that use plain formatting with support for doi/url
field. They should be part of your TeX installation, if not just run
    $ latex makebst.tex
and follow the prompts (stick to default answers in case of doubt)

compile.sh
==========
Runs the lyx2tex exporter (part of the lyx distribution) in headless
mode, typesets the guide and booklets using pdflatex. Then, it runs
elyxer to perform the HTML conversion. These steps are explained below.

How-To: TeX
===========
* To compile the full guide with pdflatex, make sure the images folder
  and ImageJRefs.bib are symlinked to the tex folder, change to the
  ./tex directory, then simply run:
    $ pdflatex user-guide.tex
  As always, you may need to run it twice to ensure correct hyperlinks

* To typeset the booklets:
    $ pdflatex user-guide-A4booklet.tex
    $ pdflatex user-guide-USbooklet.tex

How-To: LyX
===========
* Get LyX at www.lyx.org, available under a GPL license

* IJguide.module (lyx subfolder) defines all the customizations used
  by the guide and must be placed in the layouts subfolder of the LyX
  user directory (create it if needed). You can choose 'LyX>About LyX'
  to know the correct path for your installation. Run 'Lyx>Reconfigure'
  to make LyX aware of the addition. To test everything out, open
  guide-test.lyx, run 'View>View [PDF (pdflatex)]' and you should obtain
  a compiled pdf demoing some of the guide environments.
  Note that when LyX deconvolves a file back to TeX, all modules loaded
  by the document will be automatically added to the .tex file preamble

* Make sure the images folder and ImageJRefs.bib are symlinked to the
  ./lyx folder

* To build, open user-guide.lyx and choose 'View>View [PDF (pdflatex)]',
  or, from the command prompt (with [LYXDIR] being the path to the lyx
  executable directory), run:
    $ LYXDIR/lyx --force-overwrite --export pdflatex ./lyx/user-guide.lyx

How-To: HTML
============
* user-guide-html.lyx is the master file loading all the other child
  documents. It is very similar to user-guide.lyx but it does not load
  macros and commands that are 'inappropriate' for the HTML version

* you should have eLyXer (http://elyxer.nongnu.org/, available under GPL)
  available in the root folder of this file. This elyxer.py in has (tiny)
  modifications over the original, tailored to the guide.

* The output of conversion goes into ./guide/, ready to be uploaded to
  imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/. Images for the HTML version should be
  pre-resized to the final dimensions using Resize_snapshots.ijm (utils
  subfolder) and placed in ./guide/images/. A basic conversion would be
    $ elyxer.py ./lyx/user-guide-html.lyx ./guide/user-guide.html
  but for a proper output a couple of parameters must be specified. These
  are detailed in compile.sh. To know more about the options used, type
    $ python elyxer.py --help

* guide.css in ./guide/css/ contains the CSS customizations used by the
  guide. It is built on top of the CSS templates on ./html/css/ (mainly
  code from A. Fernandez). JavaScript functions are in ./guide/js/

* The final tweaks (such as removal of latex markup/environments that do
  not make sense on HTML) are done by bulk search & replace using grep.
  At the moment this is done using CleanseGuide.textfactory, a textfactory
  (.plist file) for BBEdit/TexWrangler, a closed source text editors for
  Mac OS X.

TO DO
=====
1) Optimize the grep patterns and substitute textfactories with a proper
   shell script
2) Modify eLyXer source code to split pages using section names and not
   incremental counters. E.g.: 'imagemenu.html#Threshold' instead of bogus
   '1.46.html#toc-Subsection-25.2'
3) Substitute IJguide.module with a proper LaTeX2e class
4) Modify eLyXer source code to optimize the HTML conversion

KNOWN BUGS
==========
1) elyxer fails if there are href with images in description labels
   (they exist in 06-shortcuts)
