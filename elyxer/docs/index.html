eLyXer (pronounced <i>elixir</i>) is a LyX to HTML converter. While there are a ton of such projects all over the web, eLyXer has a clear focus on flexibility and elegant output.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<a class="URL" href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> is a wonderful text editor which produces beautiful PDF files. Internally it exports documents to LaTeX, and from there to PDF. Sadly there is not an equivalent &ldquo;export to HTML&rdquo; option… Until now! With eLyXer you can convert your master’s thesis, learned article, fascinating novel or love letter to a web page that you can then share, publish on the web or import into other text editors.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The <a class="URL" href="userguide.html">user guide</a> can be accessed online. The <a class="URL" href="devguide.html">developer guide</a> is recommended reading for people that want to contribute to the development, especially <a class="URL" href="devguide.html#toc-Section-3">section 3</a>. For the mathematically inclined: be sure to visit the <a class="URL" href="math.html">Math Showcase</a>.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--1"></a>Requirements
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
eLyXer is a standalone tool: it does not require that LyX is installed to run. It can convert documents generated with versions of LyX from 1.5.5 through 2.0 (and probably earlier versions). It requires Python 2.3.4, and should work with versions up to 2.6.1. It has been tested to run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Resource usage is minimum. Converting UserGuide.lyx (<span class="formula">154</span> pages, about <span class="formula">40000</span> words) takes less than 15 seconds on my Asus EeePC 1000H, which sports an Intel Atom processor at 1.60 GHz. Memory usage is also quite frugal, remaining at about 35 MB even with in-memory processing.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The output requires XHTML, CSS2 and Unicode; any CSS2-compatible browser should do. Minimum browser versions for some popular programs are: Microsoft Internet Explorer 7, Mozilla Firefox 3, Safari 3 and Chrome 1.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--2"></a>Usage
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
eLyXer is a command line tool written in Python. Installation is done using the included installer; just type at the prompt as root:
</div>
<pre class="LyX-Code">
<tt><span class="blue">#</span> python install.py</tt>
</pre>
<div class="Unindented">
or, on Windows:
</div>
<pre class="LyX-Code">
<tt><span class="blue">&gt;</span> Python.exe install.py</tt>
</pre>
<div class="Unindented">
Basic usage is as simple as writing at the command line prompt:
</div>
<pre class="LyX-Code">
<tt><span class="blue">$</span> elyxer.py document.lyx page.html</tt>
</pre>
<div class="Unindented">
or, on Windows:
</div>
<pre class="LyX-Code">
<tt><span class="blue">&gt;</span> elyxer.py document.lyx page.html</tt>
</pre>
<div class="Unindented">
where <tt>document.lyx</tt> is your LyX document, and <tt>page.html</tt> is the resulting HTML page. Write
</div>
<pre class="LyX-Code">
<tt><span class="blue">$</span> elyxer.py --help</tt>
</pre>
<div class="Unindented">

Thanks to <a class="URL" href="http://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/resume/">Stevan White</a> for encouraging me to publish the tool. Thanks also to <a class="URL" href="http://www.johndcook.com/">John D. Cook</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://community.jedit.org/?q=node/view/1746">rikal</a>, <a class="URL" href="http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/omhelp/stdfun.htm">Bradley M.

More thanks go to Christian Ridderström for helping me out right at the start; to Ignacio García for relentless encouragement; to Abdelrazak Younes, Pavel Sanda, Günter Milde, Olivier Ripoll, José Matos, Iain Mac Donald, Uwe Stöhr for their interesting suggestions. Thanks to Uwe Stöhr, Hans Bezemer, Sara Teinturier for their translations. Packagers Sven Hoexter (for Debian) and Uwe Stöhr (on Windows) have helped with their work to make it easy to try it out. Olivier Ripoll, Geremy Condra, Simon South, Jack Desert, <a class="URL" href="http://www.newearthbiomed.org/">John Boik</a>, Yan Wong, Jose Ramón Álvarez Sánchez, Günter Milde, Pascal Francq, Marco R. Gazzetta have provided quite interesting patches. Davide P. Cervone has been extremely helpful and responsive about jsMath and MathJax integration, while Paul Hunter has also gone beyond the call of duty with his help integrating <a class="URL" href="http://www.mathtoweb.com/">MathToWeb</a> (which unfortunately has not been fruitful yet, due to my lack of skill and certainly not to his lack of interest).

A silent &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; goes to all those who downloaded the tool and silently tested it to their satisfaction (or were not bugged enough to write about it). Thanks to those who have criticized the tool for making eLyXer improve every day, if only to prove you wrong. And finally thanks to all those who have helped and yet I am now forgetting about them, for not hating me for it.
